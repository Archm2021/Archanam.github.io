    <h3><span>Title: </span>Detection of soil nuetrients using IOT</h3>
    <h3><span>Description: </span>Agriculture is the backbone of all the developing countries. Focusing on encouraging
		innovation in agriculture, smart farming is the answer to the problems that the industry is
		currently facing. All this can be done using the smart phones and IOT devices. Due to the
		rapid increase in the population, the production of crops has to be increased. To produce
		more efficient crops, moisture, temperature and pH is more important. Crop growth is based
		on soil nutrient level and its moisture level. Hence the nutrient level has to be monitored
		frequently for crop production. For this there are various techniques for nutrient detection.
		The proposed system is going to check the amount of the three main nutrients which are
		nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium in the soil using colour sensor and dispense the required
		deficient nutrient. The system also provides ph value ,temperature,moisture,and humidity
		level of soil using pH sensor,DHT11 sensor,and moisture sensor along with raspberry pi.
		The values are then stored and upload to cloud server for future use.Then the information is
		sent to farmer mobile through a email and Message.In this way the proposed system helps in
		assist the farmer for high yield crop production.</h3>
